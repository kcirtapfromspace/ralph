## Codebase Patterns
- UI modules are in src/ui/ with mod.rs re-exporting public types
- Use `owo-colors` for terminal coloring via Theme struct from colors.rs
- Use `crossterm` for terminal control (cursor, clearing)
- Use `ctrlc` crate with "termination" feature for interrupt handling
- Ghostty synchronized output uses escape codes `\x1b[?2026h` and `\x1b[?2026l`
- Time-based random selection uses SystemTime::now().subsec_nanos() % choices.len()
- ASCII art stored as &'static str constants
- Tests in each module use #[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... } pattern

## 2026-01-17 - US-001
- What was implemented: Verified existing mascot module implementation; added missing ctrlc dependency
- Files changed:
  - src/ui/mascot.rs (already existed with full implementation)
  - src/ui/mod.rs (exports mascot types)
  - Cargo.toml (added ctrlc dependency)
  - Cargo.lock (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The entire UI module was pre-implemented but not committed. Contains: mascot, colors, display, ghostty, help, interrupt, quality_gates, spinner, story_view, summary
  - Missing dependency `ctrlc` caused build failure - always run `cargo check` before assuming code works
  - US-002 (PeekAnimation) and US-003 (HelpRenderer integration) appear to already be implemented in the existing code
