## Codebase Patterns
- UI modules are in src/ui/ with mod.rs re-exporting public types
- Use `owo-colors` for terminal coloring via Theme struct from colors.rs
- Use `crossterm` for terminal control (cursor, clearing)
- Use `ctrlc` crate with "termination" feature for interrupt handling
- Ghostty synchronized output uses escape codes `\x1b[?2026h` and `\x1b[?2026l`
- Time-based random selection uses SystemTime::now().subsec_nanos() % choices.len()
- ASCII art stored as &'static str constants
- Tests in each module use #[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... } pattern

## 2026-01-17 - US-001
- What was implemented: Verified existing mascot module implementation; added missing ctrlc dependency
- Files changed:
  - src/ui/mascot.rs (already existed with full implementation)
  - src/ui/mod.rs (exports mascot types)
  - Cargo.toml (added ctrlc dependency)
  - Cargo.lock (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The entire UI module was pre-implemented but not committed. Contains: mascot, colors, display, ghostty, help, interrupt, quality_gates, spinner, story_view, summary
  - Missing dependency `ctrlc` caused build failure - always run `cargo check` before assuming code works
  - US-002 (PeekAnimation) and US-003 (HelpRenderer integration) appear to already be implemented in the existing code

## 2026-01-17 - US-002
- What was implemented: Verified existing peek animation and MascotRenderer implementation
- Files changed:
  - No code changes needed - implementation was already included in US-001 commit (90b7f39)
  - prd.json (marked US-002 as passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The mascot.rs module includes complete PeekAnimation with PEEK_FRAMES constants (5 frames per mascot)
  - AnimationConfig provides configurable frame_delay_ms (default 80ms)
  - PeekAnimation.play() uses ANSI escape codes: `\x1b[?25l` (hide cursor), `\x1b[?25h` (show cursor)
  - Ghostty sync uses `\x1b[?2026h` (begin) and `\x1b[?2026l` (end) for flicker-free rendering
  - MascotRenderer provides render_with_quote() and render_beside_content() methods
  - 12 dedicated mascot tests all passing
